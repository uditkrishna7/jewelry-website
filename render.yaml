    # After deploy, ensure the SQLite DB is created and seeded.
    # For Render's YAML, post-deploy hooks aren't standardized in all plans; you can
    # rely on the app's auto-init (server/app.js will run init if DB file is missing)
    # or run `node server/init-db.js` manually in the Render shell after the first deploy.
